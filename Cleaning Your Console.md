Should the exterior of your Ion Classic console require cleaning, gently wipe it with a dampened (not dripping), non-abrasive paper towel or soft cloth. If this does not clean the console sufficiently, you may apply some window cleaner (containing ammonia is fine) to the cloth and repeat the process until clean.

More information about cleaning your console is available at the ETC Support Site, support.etcconnect.com.
