Channel intensity can be set manually in several ways on the Ion Classic console:

1. **Keypad:** Enter a numerical value (0-100%) after selecting the channel(s).
2. **Intensity Palette:** Recall a pre-programmed intensity level from a palette.
3. **Level Wheel:** Roll the wheel up to increase intensity or down to decrease it.

The console also offers special keys for intensity control:

- **[Level]:** Sets the selected channel(s) to a default level (80% by default, but customizable in Setup).
- **[+%]:** Increases intensity by a set percentage (10% by default).
- **[-%]:** Decreases intensity by a set percentage (10% by default).
- **[Full]:** Sets intensity to 100%.
- **[Out]:** Fades intensity to 0%.

**Examples:**

- [1] [+] [3] [At] [5] [Enter]: Selects channels 1 and 3, sets intensity to 50%.
- [1] [Thru] [5] [-] [4] [Full] [Enter]: Selects channels 1 through 5 (except 4), sets intensity to 100%.
- [1] [Thru] [8] [At] [+] [3] [Enter]: Adds 30% to the intensity of channels 1 through 8.
- [5] [Thru] [8] [At] [/] [3] [Enter]: Scales down intensity of channels 5 through 8 by 30%.
- [2] [+] [5] [level wheel]: Use the level wheel to adjust intensity of channels 2 and 5.

> **Note:** The [Level], [+%], and [-%] keys have default values that can be changed in the Setup menu.
