### Power Down the Dimmer Rack (Prompt Side Door, Wings) - 6 Power Switches

1. **Safety First**: Before you begin the power-down process, ensure that all safety protocols are still in place. Check that the area around the dimmer rack remains clear and that the rack is not overheating.

2. **System Check**: Perform a quick system check to ensure all lights and equipment connected to the dimmer rack are no longer in use. This helps prevent any sudden loss of lighting that could affect the area or show.

3. **Deactivate the Switches**: Turn off each of the 6 power switches on the dimmer rack. If your system has a master switch, this should be the last one you turn off. Watch for the indicator lights to go off, signaling that the power is being cut from the rack.

4. **Power Down Sequence**: Follow the manufacturer's recommended sequence for powering down, if specified, to avoid any potential electrical issues or damage to the equipment.

5. **Check Connections**: Once the dimmer rack is powered down, quickly check that all cables, including power and DMX or network cables, remain securely in place. This is to ensure they are not a tripping hazard and are ready for the next use.

6. **Inspect the Dimmer Rack**: After powering down, inspect the dimmer rack for any signs of damage or wear that may have occurred during operation. Address any issues to ensure the longevity and safety of the equipment.

### Power Down the Lighting Desk

1. **Preparation**: Before powering down the lighting desk, ensure that all operations are complete and that the desk is no longer controlling any active lighting fixtures.

2. **Save Your Work**: Save any settings, cues, or configurations you may have adjusted during use. This ensures that your work is not lost and can be easily accessed the next time the desk is powered on.

3. **Power Off**: Locate the power switch or button on the lighting desk, usually found on the back or side of the console. Flip the switch or press the button to power down the desk.

4. **Boot Down**: Allow the lighting desk a few moments to properly shut down. Some desks may perform a shutdown sequence to safely power off.

5. **Final Checks**: Once the desk is powered off, check for any error messages or alerts that may indicate issues during shutdown. Resolve any issues before leaving the desk.

6. **Disconnect**: If necessary, and especially if the desk will not be used for an extended period, disconnect the power and any data connections. This helps protect the desk from power surges and potential damage.

7. **Ready for Next Use**: With the dimmer rack and lighting desk powered down and all checks completed, your equipment is now safely shut down and ready for the next use.
