To create a new show file in the Ion Classic console, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **File** > **New** in the browser menu and press [Select].
2. You will be prompted to confirm the creation of a new show file, as this will erase any unsaved data. Press {OK} to confirm or {Cancel} to abort.
3. If you want to include your Augment3d model in the new show, check the box labeled "Preserve Augment3d Model."
4. On the Ion Classic console, you can optionally select {Patch 1to1} to create a new show with a 1-to-1 patch and channel-to-sub assignment.
