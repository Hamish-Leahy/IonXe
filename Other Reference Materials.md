### Help System

A key help system is contained within your system. To access help, press and hold [Help] and press any key to see:

- The name of the key.
- A description of what the key enables you to do.
- Syntax examples for using the key (if applicable).
- Links to topics in the manual.

> **Note:** Key help is included on most tangible action buttons on your Ion Classic console. This includes most softkeys and touch buttons as well as the traditional keys on the keypad.

> **Note:** As with hard keys, the "press and hold [Help]" action can be used with softkeys and touch buttons as well.
