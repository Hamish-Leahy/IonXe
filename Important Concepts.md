Before using your Ion Classic console, you should familiarize yourself with the following concepts:

- **Channel:** A single numerical name used to control dimmers, groups of dimmers, or entire automated fixtures.
- **Address:** Numerical identifiers set on dimmers, fixtures, or other devices you want to control.
- **Record Targets:** Locations where you can store data (cues, palettes, macros).
- **Cues:** Collections of channel data with levels, timing, and attributes.
- **Cue List Ownership:** How the console determines which cue list controls a channel.
- **Syntax Structure:** The specific format for entering commands.
- **Parameters and Parameter Categories:** How the console organizes fixture properties (Intensity, Focus, Color, Beam).
- **Tracking vs. Cue Only:** How the console handles changes to cue data.
- **Move Instruction:** Any change to a parameter from its previously stored value.
- **Manual Data:** Values set for a channel via the command line.
- **Move Fade:** The lighting control philosophy used by the Ion Classic.
- **Block vs. Assert:** Blocking is for editing, while asserting forces playback of a value.
- **Live and Blind:** Methods for viewing and editing data. Live is the current output, Blind is stored data.
- **HTP vs. LTP:** Highest Takes Precedence (HTP) vs. Latest Takes Precedence (LTP) for determining parameter output.
