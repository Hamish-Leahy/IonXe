This manual is for use with the Ion Classic control systems. In order to be specific about where features and commands are found, the following naming and text conventions will be used:

- Browser menus and commands are indicated in **bold text**. For example: In the File menu, click Open.
- Alphanumeric keyboard buttons are indicated in all CAPS. For example, ALT or CTRL.
- Facepanel buttons are indicated in bold [brackets]. For example, [Live] or [Enter].
- Optional keys which don't have to be pressed are indicated in <angle brackets>, for example, <Cue> or .
- Keys which are intended to be pressed or held simultaneously are indicated with the "and" symbol. For example, [Load] & [Timing Disable].
- Softkeys and direct selects are indicated in bold {braces}. A note about <More SK> (more softkeys): this command is always indicated as optional, and is only indicated once in an instruction regardless of how many pages of softkeys exist. This is because there is no way to predict what softkey page you are on at any given time. Press More Softkeys until you find the required command.
- References to other parts of the manual are indicated in underlined blue (for example, Introduction). When viewing this manual electronically, click on the reference to jump to that section of the manual.

> **Note:** Notes are helpful hints and information that is supplemental to the main text.

> **Caution:** A Caution statement indicates situations where there may be undefined or unwanted consequences of an action, potential for data loss, or an equipment problem.

> **Warning:** A Warning statement indicates situations where damage may occur, people may be harmed, or there are serious or dangerous consequences of an action.
