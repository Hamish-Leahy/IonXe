### Power on the Dimmer Rack (Prompt Side Door, Wings) - 6 Power Switches

1. **Safety First**: Before you begin, ensure that all safety protocols are in place. Check that the area around the dimmer rack is clear of any obstructions and that the rack itself is properly ventilated to prevent overheating.

2. **Inspect the Dimmer Rack**: Quickly inspect the dimmer rack for any visible signs of damage or wear. Look for frayed cables, loose connections, or anything out of the ordinary. Address any issues before proceeding.

3. **Check Connections**: Ensure that all cables connected to the dimmer rack, including power and DMX or network cables, are securely in place. This will prevent any unexpected disconnections or power issues during operation.

4. **Power On Sequence**: Locate the 6 power switches on the dimmer rack. These are typically found on the prompt side door or wings, depending on your setup. It's important to power on the switches in the correct sequence, if specified by the manufacturer, to avoid power surges or equipment damage.

5. **Activate the Switches**: Turn on each of the 6 power switches. Some systems may have a master switch that needs to be engaged before the individual switches. If your system has indicator lights, ensure they are on and showing the correct status, which usually indicates that the rack is receiving power and functioning properly.

6. **System Check**: Once the dimmer rack is powered on, perform a quick system check to ensure all dimmers are operational. This can usually be done from the lighting desk or a control software.

### Power on the Lighting Desk

1. **Preparation**: Before powering on the lighting desk, ensure that it's properly connected to the dimmer rack and any other necessary peripherals (e.g., monitors, external controllers). Check all power and data connections for security and integrity.

2. **Power On**: Locate the power switch or button on the lighting desk. This is usually found on the back or side of the console. Flip the switch or press the button to power on the desk.

3. **Boot Up**: Allow the lighting desk a few moments to boot up. This process can take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on the complexity and age of the desk. During this time, the desk may run through a series of checks and calibrations.

4. **Initial Checks**: Once the desk is powered on, check for any error messages or alerts on the display. Resolve any issues before proceeding. Ensure that the desk is communicating correctly with the dimmer rack and that control is established.

5. **Test Controls**: Perform a quick test of the lighting desk controls to ensure everything is working as expected. This might include moving faders, pressing buttons, and navigating through menus. Confirm that the desk is sending commands to the dimmer rack and that the lights respond accordingly.

6. **Ready for Use**: With the dimmer rack and lighting desk powered on and functioning correctly, you're now ready to proceed with your lighting setup or show.
