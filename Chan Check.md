The Chan Check softkey is used to cycle through all patched channels, setting each to a specified intensity level (70% by default) while the others remain at their background levels. This is useful for testing lamps or focus.

To use Channel Check:

1. Select the starting channel and set the desired intensity level.
2. Press the Chan Check softkey.
3. Use the [Next] or [Last] keys to cycle through the channels.

Any other key press will exit Channel Check mode.
