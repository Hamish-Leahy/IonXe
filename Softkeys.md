Some of the features and displays in the Ion Classic console are accessible from the softkeys, which are located under the Browser. Softkeys are indicated in documentation with bold {braces}.

The softkeys are context-sensitive, meaning they change to display options relevant to the current display or command. The white labels on the bottom row indicate the active softkeys. The gray labels in the top row indicate the second page of available softkeys, accessible by pressing the [More SK] button.

These softkeys correspond to buttons [S1] - [S6] and [More SK] on the face panel.

### Changing Softkey Pages

When there are more softkeys than the six available buttons, both gray and white softkey labels will be visible. The white labels on the bottom row indicate the active softkeys, and the gray labels in the top row indicate the second page of softkeys.

To access the second page of softkeys, press the [More SK] button. To return to the previous softkeys, press [More SK] again.
