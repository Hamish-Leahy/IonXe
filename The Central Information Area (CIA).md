- **Softkeys:** Context-sensitive buttons below the browser.
- **CIA Icons:** Three icons above the CIA:
    - **Favorite CIA Display:** Select a favorite default display for the CIA (default is Browser).
    - **Collapse/Expand:** Hide or show the CIA.
    - **Lock:** Prevent the CIA from being collapsed or expanded.

### Command Line

This is where commands appear when entered. It displays in gold when in Live and blue when in Blind. Press [Clear] to remove commands from a terminated command line, or [Shift] & [Clear] to remove commands from an unterminated command line.

The command line also has a search function, accessible by pressing the search icon at the end of the command line or using [Shift] & [About]. This allows you to search recorded targets, effects, and channels.

### Parameter Display

This area shows parameters available for patched channels and allows you to select parameters for Live/Blind displays or command line control. It changes dynamically based on the selected channel and its parameters. The parameter display can be collapsed when working with displays like About and Query.

### Parameter Category Button Labels

These labels (Intensity, Focus, Color, Beam) correspond to the buttons beneath the Parameter Display. They are used to select parameter categories and change encoder pages. To post a parameter category to the command line, use [Shift] & [Encoder Page Button].

### Browser

The browser is the interface for functions like saving and loading shows, opening displays, etc. Press [Displays] to open it.

### Softkeys

Softkeys are context-sensitive buttons located under the Browser. They change to display options relevant to the current display or command. White labels indicate active softkeys, while gray labels (accessed by pressing [More SK]) show the second page of available softkeys.
