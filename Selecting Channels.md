The Ion Classic console offers multiple ways to select channels for manual control:

1. **Control Keypad:**
    
    - Use the [+], [-], and [Thru] keys for consecutive or non-consecutive channel selection.
    - Examples:
        - [5] [Enter]: Selects channel 5.
        - [5] [+] [7] [Enter]: Selects channels 5 and 7.
        - [5] [Thru] [9] [Enter]: Selects channels 5 through 9.
        - [2] [Thru] [8] [-] [5] [Enter]: Selects channels 2 through 8, except channel 5.
        - [-] [6] [Enter]: Removes channel 6 from the current selection.
        - [+] [1] [Enter]: Adds channel 1 to the current selection.
    
    > **Note:** You can use [+] and [-] multiple times. [Thru] lists can be in ascending or descending order.
    
2. **Groups:**
    
    - Use the [Group] key to quickly select channels from submasters, cues, palettes, or presets.
    - Examples:
        - [Group] [Cue] [1]: Selects all channels in cue 1.
        - [Group] [Sub] [3]: Selects all channels in submaster 3.
3. **Direct Selects:**
    
    - Provide one-touch selection of channels.
    - Configure a custom layout of channels on the direct selects for easy access.
    - Double-press a channel button to select only that channel and deselect others.
4. **[Next] and [Last] Buttons:**
    
    - Increment and decrement channel selection.
    - When multiple channels are selected, these buttons select the first or last channel in the list.
5. **Offset ({Offset}):**
    
    - Select a range of channels from a broader selection.
    - Use with [+], [-], and numeric keys to create channel offsets.
    - Examples:
        - [1] [Thru] [10] {Offset} {Even} [Enter]: Selects even channels 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
        - [1] [Thru] [20] {Offset} [3] [Enter]: Selects every third channel (1, 4, 7...19).

> **Note:** The [Thru] command and offset feature work with the current flexichannel state. Channels not included in the flexichannel mode are not selected. Use [Thru] [Thru] to override this behavior.
